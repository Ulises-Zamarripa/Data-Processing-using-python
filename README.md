# Cleanup-and-preparation-of-a-dataset-using-python

In this repository, we (SKYNET) will select a raw dataset from Kaggle  ( Hotel Bookings )
Perform a cleanup on it using these guidelines:
- Feature engineering
- One-hot encoding
- Filling Nan and Null values with appropriate values
- Scaling: Changing the range of your data
- Normalization: Adjusting the shape of your data's distribution
- Encoding: Converting categorical data to numbers
- Show the data before and after cleanup

We will also discuss and write a paper with all the techniques we implemented. And how we plan to use this dataset to solve a real-world ML problem
