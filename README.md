# Cleanup-and-preparation-of-a-dataset-using-python

-Make sure you download the .ipynb and the .csv files into the same folder-

In this repository, we (SKYNET) will select a raw dataset from Kaggle  ( Hotel Bookings )
Perform a cleanup on it using these guidelines:
- Feature engineering
- One-hot encoding
- Filling Nan and Null values with appropriate values
- Scaling: Changing the range of your data
- Normalization: Adjusting the shape of your data's distribution
- Encoding: Converting categorical data to numbers
- Discuss and write a paper with all the techniques we implemented
- Show the data before and after cleanup
- How we will use this dataset to solve a real-world ML problem
